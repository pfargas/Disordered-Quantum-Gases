  abstract = {This paper presents a simple model for such processes as spin diffusion or conduction in the "impurity band." These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between localized sites. In this simple model the essential randomness is introduced by requiring the energy to vary randomly from site to site. It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.},

  abstract = {The work of Heisenberg Majorana and Wigner seems to show that the behaviour of protons and neutrons and their interaction in the nucleus may be described by the ordinary methods of quantum mechanics. It is of particular interest to study the simplest nuclear system, i. e., the diplon, which almost certainly consists of a proton and a neutron. In dealing with such a two-body problem, the wave equation can be rigorously solved if the forces are known, and this problem therefore has the same importance for nuclear mechanics as the hydrogen atom has for atomic theory. The force acting between a proton and a neutron has been investigated by Wigner (loc. cit.) who showed that in order to understand the high mass defect of He4 compared with H2 one must assume interaction forces with a range much smaller than the radius of H2. Without knowing about these forces more than the binding energy of H2, one can, then, investigate quantitatively the behaviour of H2 against various perturbations.},

A natural consequence of our investigation is the requirement of a delta-function multiplied by a regularization operator to model the zero-range limit of the finite-square well when the dimensionality is greater than one. The case of two dimensions turns out to be surprisingly subtle, and needs to be treated separately from all other dimensions.},

This is illustrated by a detailed analysis of the one-dimensional case.},

  abstract = {We study the transport properties of defective single-walled armchair carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a mesoscopic length scale. Monovacancies and divancancies are positioned randomly along the CNT. The calculations are based on a fast, linearly scaling recursive Green's function formalism that allows us to treat large systems quantummechanically. The electronic structure of the CNT is described by a density-functional-based tight-binding model. We determine the influence of the defects on the transmission function for a given defect density by statistical analysis. We show that the system is in the regime of strong localization (e.g. Anderson localization). In the limit of large disorder the conductance scales exponentially with the number of defects. This allows us to extract the localization length. Furthermore, we study in a systematic and comprehensive way, how the conductance, the conductance distribution, and the localization length depend on defect probability, CNT diameter, and temperature.},
