\section{Introduction}

The \textit{wave-particle duality} is one of the most famous behaviours that arise when considering particles in the quantum regime. The Schr√∂dinger equation treats quantum objects as a complex wave, \textit{the wavefunction of the particle}, the physical interpretation of which is that the square of this wavefunction represents the probability distribution function of the position of the quantum object.

This new way of understanding particles makes wave phenomena possible, like interference when two particles interact with each other or diffusion in a medium. In this work, we try to understand a wave phenomenon called \textit{localisation}. 

In the classical sense, all particles are localized: they have a defined position, but for a wave, this statement might not be true: In general, waves span over a large region, for example, if we emit an electromagnetic wave from a source into an empty universe this wave will be propagated throughout all space. Using the interference of different waves, one can also find localised waves, such as the \textit{wave packet}.

In this work, we try to study strong localisation inside a medium.
