\subsection{Anderson localisation}

In 1958, P. W. Anderson [reference] showed that enough structural disorder in a solid-state system, can exhibit localisation of states. Those states present an exponential decaying tail in the probability density function, which leads to the confinement of particles in times much larger than the characteristic time of the system which implies that quantum particles inside such a system can be confined in a region of space in which classical particles are not.

This phenomena emerges when treating particles as waves, and studying the scattering processes that take place. If the disorder is strong enough, the wave function interacts with itself resulting in a constructive interference in a small region of space.

This effect has been observed in various systems, such as light in disordered media \cite{wiersma_localization_1997}, sound waves in acoustic systems \cite{hu_localization_2018}, and electrons in solids \cite{abrahams_scaling_1979}. In the case of electrons, Anderson localisation is a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics, as it is responsible for the insulating behaviour of disordered materials. Understanding this effect is crucial for the development of the knowledge in electronic transport properties [Examples in the video of the russian researcher].

\subsection{Ultracold atoms for quantum simulation}

Ultracold atoms have been demostrated to be a versatile platform for the study of quantum many-body systems. The ability to control the interactions between atoms [Feshbach resonances], the external potential [laser physics], and the temperature of the system [evaporative cooling...], allows for the study of a wide range of phenomena and interactions, such as superfluidity, bose-einstein condensation, dipolar systems, and many others.

In 2015, [Gavish Castin] proposed this platform as a way to study Anderson localisation in a quantum regime. The proposal was to build an optical lattice with a low filling factor of an atom B, the scatterers, such that the effect of the lattice would not be noticeable. Then, a second species of atoms A, would be released into this disordered media with a low energy, such that the interaction between A and B would be an s-wave ($l=0$ in the angular momentum). The scatterers are prepared in the vibrational ground state of the optical lattice, and the atoms A interact with B atoms with a lower energy than the recoil energy of the lattice, such that the interaction is elastic (B atoms don't move). B atoms are modelled as gaussian potentials, so the potential landscape that A atoms see is a set of gaussians distributed randomly throughout the confined space.

\subsection{The pseudopotential approximation. Conditions in the wave function}

In the setup considered in this work, the interaction between the scatterers and the particles A is modelled as the typical Yuan and Hang delta-like pseudopotential. The pseudopotential technique consists in approximating a potential for some other easier potential, given some conditions. In our case, we consider that the B particles are far away from the others, so that the overlap between B atoms is negligible. For the low filling factor considered, this should be a good approximation. The pseudopotential is given by

\begin{equation} %NOT OK!!
    V(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{0} \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{i})
\end{equation}

This potential is a first approximation to the problem. We should take into account that this picture is not the full picture of the problem, for example, as this potential is infinitessimally thin, we can't study percolation processes in this system, while with gaussians, if the filling factor is high enough, and the B atoms extense enough, this effect could have a big impact.

The description of the system with this potential, can also be understood in terms of the free Schr√∂dinger equation, with boundary conditions at the position of the scatterers. The Wigner-Bethe-Peierls condition is an equivalent treatment of the problem with this pseudopotential [Bethe article], but it has a nicer interpretation. The condition for each dimension is given by:

\begin{equation} % PUT CONDITION
    % \psi(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{+}) - \psi(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{-}) = -\frac{2m}{\hbar^{2}} V_{0} \psi(\mathbf{r}_{i})
    ---
\end{equation}

Which means that we will describe the problem as free particles with these boundary conditions.

EXACT PROBLEM: EXACT DIAGONALISATION 

\subsection{The Fermi gas: Non-interacting fermions}

The final objective of this thesis is to study a non-interacting Fermi sea in the presence of disordered scatterers in a finite volume.
